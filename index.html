        <h1>Welcome to your managing money journey!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This year, as part of my digital technology class project, I had to create an educational digital outcome. So, for my educational topic, I chose money management.</p>
        <p>In my website, there are information about things like savings, budgeting and loans, and some activities that can help you better understand these skills.</p>
