        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Year 13 student at Westlake Girls High School. This year, as part of my Year 13 digital technology project, we were told to create an educational digital outcome that focuses on an issue in the world. So, I chose the issue of Quality Education, which is one of the UN's sustainable development goals. Within this issue, I narrowed my focus down to one particular area, money management.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The website that I have created is to help educate students in New Zealand about some of the basics of money management. The purpose of this is to combine information from different sites into one platform that is accessible to students and is kid-friendly. I tried to keep everything as simple as possible to make your learning easy.</p>
        <p>From doing research at the start of this year, it helped me understand a few things. Currently a lot of young people don’t know how to manage their money. They waste money on unnecessary things; they don’t know how to save and budget their money; they don’t understand how to create a bank account; and they don’t know how to start up a KiwiSaver account to prepare themselves for the future. This is a problem that will lead to a country with a lot more people depending on the government for money and benefits so that they can survive because they didn’t learn how to manage their money and keep track of their spendings and funds.</p>
